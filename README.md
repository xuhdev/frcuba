# FrCuba

A more friendly interface of the [Cuba integration library][1]. An example is
in test.c. After you have read the manual of Cuba, the usage is pretty
straightforward as shown in test.c.

The code amount is fairly small, thus, to use this interface is to copy the
source files into your project. To download the source files, you can either
use git:

    git clone https://github.com/xuhdev/frcuba.git

Or follow [this link][2] to download the tarball:

    curl -L https://github.com/xuhdev/frcuba/archive/master.tar.gz >frcuba.tar.gz
